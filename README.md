# HolyLibrary

HolyLibrary is a web-based application designed to manage and browse large libraries of CBZ files (comic book archives). It focuses on providing a seamless experience for users who require a fast, scalable, and reliable solution for their personal collections. The application is built with simplicity in mind, ensuring ease of use while offering the necessary tools for managing, viewing, and exploring CBZ archives.

## Vision

HolyLibrary aims to serve as a lightweight, self-hosted solution for individuals who cherish their digital comic collections. While there are many tools available for media management, few prioritize speed, efficiency, and flexibility in such a way that scales gracefully with the size of the library. HolyLibrary strives to fill that gap by offering a platform that feels natural to use, even with extensive collections.

## Goals

1. **Primary Objective: Intuitive Browsing**
   - Provide users with a smooth and fast browsing experience for their CBZ collections.
   - Ensure that the user interface is minimalistic, yet powerful, with tools to quickly locate and open desired content.
   - Allow users to effortlessly browse, filter, and sort through thousands of entries.

2. **Metadata Management**
   - Extract metadata directly from CBZ files when available.
   - Offer optional metadata editing through JSON files, ensuring the original CBZ files remain untouched unless the user explicitly chooses to update them.
   - Support both automatic metadata recognition and manual customization.

3. **User Personalization**
   - Enable account-based personalization for features like:
     - Favorite files.
     - Tracking most-read items.
     - User-specific preferences for viewing and organization.
   - Facilitate multi-user setups with shared but customizable experiences.

4. **Scalability for Large Libraries**
   - HolyLibrary is built to handle extensive libraries with tens of thousands of files without compromising performance.
   - Use advanced backend architecture and database indexing to ensure seamless access and queries, even in massive collections.

5. **Future-Proof Design**
   - Ensure the system is modular and extensible, making it easy to integrate additional features like advanced statistics, tag management, or AI-based content recommendations.
   - Design with cross-platform compatibility in mind, supporting browsers as the primary access point while leaving room for native applications in the future.

6. **Security and Privacy**
   - HolyLibrary respects the privacy of its users by keeping all data local and under their control.
   - Provide robust authentication and access control for multi-user environments.
   - Implement industry-standard encryption and secure communication protocols.

   - A customizable dashboard to showcase library statistics:
     - Most-read files.
     - Recently added files.
     - User-specific insights (e.g., reading history, favorites).

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - HolyLibrary leverages backend optimizations to minimize response times, even for demanding operations like searching or metadata extraction.
   - Advanced caching mechanisms ensure smooth performance, even with limited system resources.

5. **Statistical Insights**

## Guiding Principles

- **Performance Matters**:
  Every millisecond counts. HolyLibrary is designed to deliver fast responses, even under heavy workloads. The focus is always on making the user feel like the system is working at the speed of thought.

  HolyLibrary doesn’t assume ownership of your data. All files remain under your control, and the system is designed to be non-invasive. No modifications are made to original files unless explicitly requested.

- **Simplicity Without Sacrificing Power**:
  While offering advanced features, the interface and functionality are crafted to be intuitive for users of all technical backgrounds.

- **Open Collaboration**:
  While HolyLibrary is built with strong ownership and direction, forks and improvements from the community are encouraged, provided the original authorship is respected.
